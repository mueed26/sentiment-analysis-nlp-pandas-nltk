# sentiment-analysis-nlp-pandas-nltk
This repository showcases a sentiment analysis project utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with Python. The project integrates review datasets from TripAdvisor and Google Reviews, processes text data using libraries like pandas and NLTK, and visualizes insights with matplotlib. Key steps include text preprocessing through tokenization, cleaning, and case normalization, followed by unigram and n-gram analysis to uncover word frequency and patterns. The processed data lays the groundwork for sentiment classification, providing a robust pipeline for exploring customer sentiment and building advanced models. This repository serves as an excellent starting point for anyone interested in traditional NLP workflows and sentiment analysis applications. unforgunately I cannot upload the datasets file directly, but I can provide a link to the files on kaggle. 
the below link will redirect you  to the malsysian restraunts dataset, where you can downlaod data_cleaned folder. I used google collab for the porject where I loaded the dataset, but if you want to use tools like jupiter notebook, you can set your directory first and the read the csv files.
